# How to use `code`?

This module contains two notebooks:

- [0_overview](0_overview.ipynb) provides an overview of the data and includes a brief analysis of variable correlations and time series patterns.
- [example_modelling](example_modelling.ipynb) includes a modelling exercise to showcase how to use this repository can be used. It introduces potential feature transformations to enhance the predictive power of the data and an implementation of an XGBOOST model.

Finally, [utils](utils.py) contains helper functions used in some of the notebooks.
